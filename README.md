# GianBank_Sim

THIS PROJECT IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT
YOU MAY NOT USE THIS PROJECT WITHOUT PREAPPROVAL FROM ME AT THIS TIME
CONTACT- gurpret@duck.com

This is a banking simulator with the aim of growing into a full on trading simulator.

GianBank and GianTrader are not real institutions, don't deal in real money, and never require a credit card, or email to sign up for.

Overall a fun financial sim written in python and the web dev languages, vanilla html, css, and js.

For now its not available to play or use as it's under development, but when it is the site "gianbank.tk" will host it and you can play!

And until it's ready I do not give permission to use it. Feel free to browse the code, and share!
